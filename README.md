# Scripts for SV Imputation and SV-GWAS

This repository contains scripts used for data analysis and for generating figures and tables in our study on structural variation (SV) imputation, as well as for performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using imputed SVs for complex traits.<br><br>
We have developed a web-based imputation tool for imputing SVs, including Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs), in human samples with SNP data. The SNP data can be obtained from SNP arrays, SNP imputation, or whole-genome sequencing. An extensive help document is also provided to assist users with the tool for online SV imputation. For additional information, please visit our SV imputation website at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/impute_sv.<br><br>
Genome-wide association analyses have been conducted on the imputed SVs for more than 2,000 traits within the UK Biobank. Summary data from these SV-GWAS are available at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/data/ukb_sv_gwas.
