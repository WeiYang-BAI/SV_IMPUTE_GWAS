# SV imputation and GWAS

This repository houses the scripts used for data analysis, as well as for the creation of figures and tables, in the study of structural variation (SV) imputation and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). <br><br>
We have developed a web-based imputation server that enables users to impute structural variations (SVs) and Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) in human samples using SNP genotype data acquired from SNP arrays, SNP imputation, or whole-genome sequencing. We provided a comprehensive help document that guides users through its functionalities. For further details, please refer to our website at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/impute_sv. <br><br>
We performed SV and VNTR imputations in the UK Biobank cohort and subsequently conducted a GWAS. The summary data from our study can be accessed through our GWAS portal, available at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/data/ukb_sv_gwas.
