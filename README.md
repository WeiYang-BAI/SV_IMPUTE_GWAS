# SV imputation and GWAS

This repository houses the scripts used for data analysis, as well as for the creation of figures and tables, in the study of structural variation (SV) imputation and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). <br><br>
We have developed a web-based imputation server that allows users to register freely and create imputation tasks for SVs and Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) using SNP genotype data obtained from SNP arrays, SNP imputation, or whole-genome sequencing. Our server strictly adheres to a comprehensive data security policy to ensure the privacy and protection of user data. For more information about the server, please visit our website at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/impute_sv. <br><br>
We performed SV and VNTR imputations in the UK Biobank cohort and subsequently conducted a GWAS. The summary data from our study can be accessed through our GWAS portal, available at https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/data/ukb_sv_gwas.
